# Hand_Sign_Prediction

This application was developed as a part of my mini project in my 6th semester.
A website is made where the user can upload an image of a hand sign, which will then be fed to the ML model which will predict the hand sign.
A deep CNN was used which gave an accuracy of 99.8%. The project was developed in mmind for it's high scope for improvement.
